# CaImaging
This repository will be used in the Nautiyal Lab for the analysis of calcium imaging videos.
## Background
Using state-of-the-art microendoscopic technology, we can visualize the acitivty of large populations of neurons at the single-cell level in awake behaving mice. We use miniature microendoscopes which allows us to view flourescence emitted from a GFP-fused calcium indicator. 

We record the activity of neurons using the Inscopix Data Acquisition Software and process the recordings with the Inscopix Data Processing Software. To identify indiviudal neurons we have implemented the python version of the CNMF-E algorithm, (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/339564v1.full "CaImAn").
